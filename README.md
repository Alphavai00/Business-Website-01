#FARHAD BIO

Welcome! My name is Farhad Hossain. Currently, I  am a student exploring the dynamic world of media and communication".

I am part of the HSC 26 Batch and actively pursuing my dream to study at Tsinghua University, where I aim to specialize in "journalism and mass communication". I am deeply committed to "learning and aspire to make a positive impact by sharing meaningful stories and ideas that inspire and connect people."


Beyond academics, I engage in mobile journalism. My experiences have honed my ability to "analyze complex issues," "craft compelling stories," or "communicate effectively across diverse platforms"].

When I am not immersed in my studies or extracurricular activities, I enjoy "programming" "reading about global issues," "traveling to explore new cultures," or "photographing moments that tell stories"].

As I look to the future, I am driven by a vision to "champion social justice," or "create impactful narratives that challenge the status quo".

Feel free to connect with me to explore ideas, share perspectives, or collaborate on exciting projects!
